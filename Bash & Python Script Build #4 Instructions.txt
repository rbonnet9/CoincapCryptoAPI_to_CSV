Build Script 4:

Objective: Demonstrate your ability to gather data from an API and organize that data into a specific format.

Create a script that uses Bash and Python to interact with any API (Some API’s will require authentication):
1. Create a CSV file of the data you choose to store in the file.
2. Only 6 columns are required for this activity (e.g. of the MLB API: Player’s name, number, team, position, height and weight).
3. The script can be interactive or not interactive (You can allow a user to pick a or some parameter).
4. CSV file must be formatted properly.

Please submit your GitHub link of your script.

Take away: After creating your script, you will have the ability to access data from an API and format that data into a specific format; to share amongst other teams or software that can ingest that data.
